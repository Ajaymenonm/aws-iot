# Food Parameter Tracker

An IoT application that monitors parameters that are crucial in keeping food safe at places like fast food joints. 

## Architecture

This application is built using simple iot devices, sensors and leverages AWS cloud. 
There are two major parts to it:

- Edge:
    - Raspberry Pi connected to a dht22 sensor 
    (temperature and humidity)
    - Esp8266 microcontroller connected to ultrasonic level sensor
- Cloud: 
    - AWS and specifically IoT service which acts as a connectivity between physical and logical world.

Raspberry pi with dht22 sensor measures temperature and humidity at the place where food is stored / used. This could be in a fridge or on the food prep station. 

Esp8266 along with ultrasonic sensor is used to measure levels of liquid items. This could be a container of soup / sauce, etc.

The high level architecture of the application is shown in the image below.

## Application Components
### Edge

1. [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) + [DHT22](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385)
<br>
This component performs the following actions:
    - Connects to AWS IoT to communicate to and from the cloud.
    - Acts as a gateway device and connects to other node devices locally.
    - Run edge workload like collecting sensor data, local data storage, stream / batch telemetry to cloud among others.
    - DHT22 is connected to RPi as shown below in the image. It collects temperature and humidity data and does serial communication with RPi.
    - Runs a [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT broker as a demon service.
    - Connects to node device (esp8266) via mqtt to gather data.

2. [ESP8266 NodeMcu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) + [Ultrasonic Level Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569)
<br>
This component performs the following actions:
    - Connects locally to RPi via MQTT

### Cloud
1. AWS IoT Core
    - This service is used to connect a physical device to the cloud. 
    - A logical device on the AWS IoT platform is created under the concept of **"Things"**. 
    - x509 **Certificates** are created during this process and they will be used on the device to authenticate with the cloud. 
    - **Policy** is created by attaching specific roles that a resource is going to use / perform. Ex: iot publish / subscribe.
    - Policy is then attached to the certificate, which in turn is tied to the Thing. 
    
    <br>


2. AWS IoT Rules
    - Based on the data received from a topic, certain actions can be performed. 
    - More on application specific rules explained below.

3. Dynamo Db
    - `device_data` is the name of the table

        | Attribute | Primary Key | Type | Required |
        |------|-------------|------|:--------:|
        | deviceId | Partition key | String | Yes |
        | ts | Sort key | String | Yes | 
        | humidity | N/A | String | No |
        | temp | N/A | String | No |
        | level | N/A | Float | No |
4. S3
    - `all-device-telemetry` is the name of the bucket
    - Naming format: `<deviceid>/<timestamp>.csv`
    - This bucket acts as a cold storage for all device telemetry data.

5. Lambda function
    - Lambda function is used to process the compressed telemetry and dump into a S3 bucket
    - This function is setup with Node v14 runtime
    - A new policy is created with S3 Put permission and Cloudwatch log access. Policy is attched to the lambda function. The policy also specifies S3 ARN - which the lambda function now has access to PUT objects.
    - This function is triggered from AWS IoT.

## Device Software

### Core App 
 This is a device software that powers Raspberry Pi. Acts as a gateway device and also connects to other node devices locally.

#### Features:

1. DHT22 Sensor Interface

    Raspberri pi is connected to dht22 sensor via gpio ports and communicates serially. This sensor collects temperature and humidity data. 

    | Temperature | Â°C |
    |-------------|----|
    | Humidity| RH|

2. Connectivity

    - AWS IoT

      How is IoT core used in this application?
        - Register/Provision device (RPi, Web Server)
        - Connect device to cloud (RPi, Web Server)
        - Act as a MQTT broker to facilitate pub/sub between clients 
        - D2C - Device to cloud communication
        - C2D - Cloud to device communication
        - Perform various business actions using rules. Like, re-publish a message as an alert when certain criteria is met.
    - Mosquitto MQTT
        - Mosquitto mqtt broker is installed as a demon on RPi that runs in the background. 
        - Since the node device needs a way to communicate with RPi locally, the mqtt broker works well. 

        <br>

        MQTT Topic design pattern
        
        Topic Format: `<store_name>/<action_performed>/<device_id>/<communication_type>`

        | Topic Name | Topic |  Action | Broker |
        |------------|-------|---------|--------|
        | STREAM | `store/stream/deviceid` | Stream telemetry from device to cloud | AWS IoT|
        | BATCH | `store/batch/deviceid` | Batch send telemetry from device to cloud | AWS IoT|
        | ONDEMAND_REQ | `store/ondemand/deviceid/req` | Send request from web server to device for data | AWS IoT |
        | ONDEMAND_RES | `store/ondemand/deviceid/res` | Send data from device to web server on demand | AWS IoT |
        | ESP8266_REQ | `store/level/deviceid/req` | RPi requesting data from esp | Mosquitto MQTT |
        | ESP8266_RES | `store/level/deviceid/res` | Esp responding with data to RPi | Mosquitto MQTT |
        | ALERT | `store/alert/deviceid`| IoT rule publish alert | AWS IoT|


3. Telemetry

    - There are two ways telemetry is collected. One is as a result of on-demand request and the other being collected proactively at intervals. 
    - As soon as data is aggregated from sensors, it is written into a file on disk. 
    - At certain interval, this file is read, data is compressed and sent to upstream via a topic. 
    
    <br>

    On Demand request:
    
    The below sequence diagram demonstrates how an on-demand request is received, data is gathered and sent back. 

    <img src="https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/3533a7b4-4682-4229-a615-9f1ece412fb8/image.png" alt="On-demand request" width="1000"/> 

    <br>

    Interval:

    RPi also collects data at 5s interval as shown below.
    
    <img src="https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/61375c18-d71b-42e5-9c55-31ff04572832/image.png" alt="Interval request" width="1000"/> 

     <br>

    There is a sample data written in a file

    ```
       {
            "messageType":"response",
            "requestType": "ondemand"
            "deviceId":"deviceId",
            "humidity":"20",
            "temp":"10",
            "level":12.5,
            "ts":"20220316054923"
        } 
    ```

4. Rules and Alerts

    The below diagram represents how various rules are triggered based on data:

    <img src="https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/62c1f96b-b4dc-41db-b3f6-c3c30eb996f9/image.png" alt="Rules and Alerts" width="1000"/>

    <br>

    - **PublishLevelAlert**
        
        This rule publishes a message to an alert topic `store/alert/deviceid` when the level is > 20cm. 
        ```
        SELECT level, deviceId, ts FROM 'store/stream/deviceid' WHERE level > 20
        ```

    - **PublishTempAlert**

        This rule publishes a message to an alert topic `store/alert/deviceid` when the temperature is > 29C. 
        ```
        SELECT temp, deviceId, ts FROM 'store/stream/deviceid' WHERE temp > 29
        ```

    - **StoreToDynamo**

        This rule stores streaming data to a dynamo db table
        ```
        SELECT deviceId, humidity, temp, level, ts FROM 'store/stream/deviceid'
        ```
    
    - **BatchTelemetryToLambda**

        This rule redirects batched telemetry to lambda function
        ```
        SELECT * FROM 'store/batch/deviceid'
        ```

### Web server
[Adding view (button, notification box) to this app is WIP]

This app serves as a dashboard to interact with devices. 
On click of a button, an on-demand data request is sent to the device. The data is displayed instantaneous. 

It also receives alerts from IoT if certain rules are triggered.

#### Install and Run Instructions
1. Git clone the app
2. Install dependencies `npm i`
3. Run `node main.js`

<br>

### Lambda function
Lambda function is triggered by IoT rule when batch data comes in. The main function of this is to decompress the data and save this to a file in S3.
